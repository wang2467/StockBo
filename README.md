StockBo

Small Stock App that contains watchlist functionality and chat room. Stock Quotes data updated with IEXStock API which is free of charge. ReactJs as frontend and firebase as backend. Going to slowly get rid of firebase and migrate to local hosted backend(golang+sql). 

Usage:
  1. run back-end server
    In the go workspace run:
      go run *.go
  2. run front-end
    npm start
